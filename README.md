 website being made for Le Fou Frog

12/05 working on html structure, gathering information for project, figuring out texts and images needed for final presentation

12/07 still working on html structure, css slowly starting to come together , worked on lower down and hover toggles for the menu 

need to figure out how to merge hover down class with grid class 


12/11 continue to work on styling ideas, my html structure is still having issues with getting things in order

12/12 today was a very progressive day, the dropdown menu finally works, i was able to add multiple pages and link them with the main page, some formatting was done to adjust the index. Css was also adjusted accordingly. The dinner menu has been worked on as of today, and will be formatted later. Will continue to work on the other pages before finishing fonts and colors and such.

12/13 finally finished the menu page, now adding style to the page, border radius and colors. Will fix it more at a later time. 

12/18
