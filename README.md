# Le Fou Frog Website

This project is a testament to my dedication to my parents and their small business restaurant, Le Fou Frog, located in Kansas City, Missouri. While they currently have a website built on WIX, I saw an opportunity to leverage my growing skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fresh and innovative online presence for their establishment. As I progress in my studies, I plan to further enhance this project by integrating it into a library with Angular and TypeScript, accompanied by my own backend server.

## Roadmap

- 12/05/23: Initiated the project by structuring the HTML, gathering necessary information, and planning the required text and images for the final presentation.
- 12/07/23: Continued refining the HTML structure, with CSS gradually taking shape. Focused efforts on implementing lower down and hover toggles for the menu, while seeking solutions to merge hover-down class with grid class.
- 12/11/23: Continued exploration of styling ideas, addressing persistent issues with HTML structure organization.
- 12/12/23: Made significant progress with the dropdown menu functionality, successfully linking multiple pages with the main page. Implemented formatting adjustments to the index and began work on the dinner menu. CSS was adjusted accordingly.

- 12/18/23: Worked on the cocktail menu and ensured the navigation bar is present on all pages for improved user navigation. Identified and noted issues with the mobile website layout for future adjustments.
- 01/19/24: Received valuable feedback from teachers and classmates, prompting the creation of a new branch dedicated to developing a responsive website. Focus shifted towards optimizing the website for mobile devices.
- **This project has been put on hiatus as I am trying to move it over to next.js or angular**
